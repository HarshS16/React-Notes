# React-Notes

This repository holds my notes for the Javascript framework ReactJs


React is Javascript library which is used to develop single page web applications. (SPA)


It was developed by Facebook in 2011

Used to build dynamic and interative user interfaces

It is the most widely used JS library mainly used for frontend



#Working of Dom(Document object Model)
Browser takes HTML and creates DOm
Js helps us modify dom based on user actions and events
In big applications working with Dom becomes difficult with JS

#advantages
React has a simpler mental model
js is cumbersome
js is error prone
js is hard to maintain

# working of react

In react you dont need to worry about the quering and updating the dom elements
React created a webpage with small and reusable components
react will take care of updating the dom elements
it saves a lot of time and makes things convenient

# Js vs React

JS is imperative which means aapko batana pdta hai ek ek kaam ki kya krna hai kaise banana hai project
React is declarative which means you only declare the target state and then react khud figure out krta hai ki us target state tk pohochne ke liye kya steps honge

# Node Project Structure

1. Node Modules: has all the installed node packages
2. Public directory: Contains all the resources (images,videos) and static files which are displayed on the webpage and dont change like the favicon,logo

3. Src Directory: main folder for the react code
   inside src :
   i: Components : reusable components of the webpage including buttons, header footer etc
   ii: assets: Image fonts and other static files
   iii: styles: css or stylesheets

4. Package.json: contains information about the project name, version, dependencies

5. Vite.config.js : Contains info to configure vite app
