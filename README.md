# React-Notes

This repository holds my notes for the Javascript framework ReactJs

React is Javascript library which is used to develop single page web applications. (SPA)
It was developed by Facebook in 2011
Used to build dynamic and interative user interfaces
It is the most widely used JS library mainly used for frontend

#Working of Dom(Document object Model)
Browser takes HTML and creates DOm
Js helps us modify dom based on user actions and events
In big applications working with Dom becomes difficult with JS
